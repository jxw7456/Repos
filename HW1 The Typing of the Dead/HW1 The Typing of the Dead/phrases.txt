Strength in adversity is a form of greatness
Weakness is not your luxury. No one wishes that
Go bravely where you have never gone before
Never give up a dream because of the time it will take to accomplish it
Peace is only possible if you believe in it, against all odds and through all pain
Every new day, teach yourself to enjoy life
If they’re not happy then they can’t make you happy
Know your limits, your weaknesses
Travel is the best and fastest way to learn more about yourself
Great stories are shared with us to encourage us to tell our own
Keep searching for amazing people in this world because there are so many out there
Love radically
Love is the translation of chaos into beauty
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury
Cry over spilt milk
Don't count your chickens before the eggs have hatched
People have the right to be stupid
Heaven won't take me and hell's afraid I'll take over
Good Girls are only Bad girls who did not get caught

Strength in adversity is a form of greatness
Weakness is not your luxury. No one wishes that
Go bravely where you have never gone before
Never give up a dream
Peace is only possible if you believe in it
Every new day, teach yourself to enjoy life
If they’re not happy then they can’t make you happy
Know your limits, your weaknesses
Travel is the best and fastest way to learn more about yourself
Great stories are shared with us to encourage us to tell our own
Keep searching for amazing people in this world
Love radically
Love is the translation of chaos into beauty
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury
Cry over spilt milk
Don't count your chickens before the eggs hatch
People have the right to be stupid
Heaven won't take me and hell's afraid I'll take over
A Fool and His Money Are Soon Parted
Back To the Drawing Board
Foaming At The Mouth
Each one worse than the last
Statute of limitations
I’m giving you leeway
I made a complete 180 degree change in my life
Brothers in law
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here
All good things come to an end
Halmet without the prince
